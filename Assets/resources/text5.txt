It's gonna be a really pleasant day . The weather may be nice now , but the forecast for the upcoming days is not looking too good . It's gonna we very windy and it's going to rain until Sunday . Luckily , starting on Monday the weather will clear up and the sun will come out . It won't be warm yet , but it is March so spring is on the horizon and it's bound to get warmer any day now .

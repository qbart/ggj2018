The Richard Hunniwell House is one of the oldest surviving structures in the United States state of Maine. Located on Old Country Road near Black Point Road in Scarborough, Maine, this modest single-story building was probably built in 1702-03 by Richard Hunniwell, who had first settled Scarborough in 1684. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.[1] It is now owned and maintained.

The team is starting to warm up, their last twelve matches left them feeling dejected, which is understandable. They haven't had a single win in the last two seasons and even before that, the manager caused a big scandal. It's not looking good for the Lions, but they are here and they are going to give it their all, however little that may be. They tried recruiting a prominent player from another team, but have been met with rejection.
